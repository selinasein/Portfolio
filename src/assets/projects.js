    explanation:
      "Arkhet is a platform that accelerates product discovery by transforming wireframes and style guides into pixel-perfect, interactive prototypes. I contributed to developing features like seamless integration of design systems, a drag-and-drop interface for intuitive prototyping, and real-time styling updates using TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. My work focused on ensuring prototypes remained 100% consistent with style guides, streamlining ideation, and enabling rapid iteration for product-market fit. By leveraging technologies like Apollo Client and AWS Bedrock for efficient data handling, I helped empower teams to build and validate products faster and with greater precision.",
